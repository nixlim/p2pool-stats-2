P2pool Stats Page Skin/Makeover

Trying to get Web interface on the P2Pool looking nice.

Not sure what the previous intention was, but here I will be messing around with HTML, CSS, Javascript from the standard distro to make a different looking skin for the web interface for P2Pool stats page.

27.01.2014 - Ver 0.1

First edit

To use/install:

1. Download the files from GitHub
2. Save "web-static" directory as "web-static-backup"
3. Create director "web-static"
4. Copy the downloaded files into the new directory "web-static"

FROM ORIGINAL CODE
Evolution attempt from goblin/p2pool-stats.

node.js is a fine solution for the aim of the stats, BUT tailing P2Pool's log has a high I/O price.
This is an attempt at creating a node.js with JSON listeners, than can receive POST information from whatever you wish.

There's even a possibility to have MySQL doing JSON POSTs on INSERT or UPDATE - tested, still not very efficient, will come later if I can raise its performance.

The chain_img, albeit "nice", might be a bit heavy on slow connections, so it will become optional too.
